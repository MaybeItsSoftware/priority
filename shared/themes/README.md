# Shared themes

Generated from the Rust core (`core/src/theme`), which every app resolves
themes with. Do not edit by hand: change `core/src/theme/` and run either

```bash
TAKT_REGENERATE_THEMES=1 cargo test --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml theme
TAKT_REGENERATE_THEMES=1 swift test --filter TaktCoreTests.ThemeConformanceTests
```

The core's own tests (`core/src/theme/tests.rs`) rebuild every file here from
its inputs and fail on any byte that differs; so do `ThemeConformanceTests`
through the Swift bindings, and Android's `ThemeConformanceTest` through the
Kotlin ones. A new case is added to the list in
`corelogic-tests/ThemeConformanceTests.swift`. The theme format itself is in
[`docs/themes.md`](../../docs/themes.md).

## `priority.json`, `chalk.json`, `chalk-dark.json`

The built-ins as complete theme files. Every colour and every structural value
is stated, `extends` is `null`, `structure` holds the Mac's values, and
`platforms.ios` / `platforms.android` hold the phones' differences from them.
They resolve like any other file, so a reader needs no built-in of its own.
`priority.json` is the default; `chalk.json` and `chalk-dark.json` are Zed and
Zed Dark, under their old file names. It
loads these as its built-ins. The Android app copies them into its assets.

## `conformance/*.json`

One resolution case per file:

```json
{
  "files": [ { "name": "dusk.json", "json": "<the file's text>" } ],
  "selected": "user.dusk",
  "expected": {
    "macos":   { "light": <resolved>, "dark": <resolved> },
    "ios":     { "light": <resolved>, "dark": <resolved> },
    "android": { "light": <resolved>, "dark": <resolved> }
  },
  "issues": [ { "source": "dusk.json", "severity": "error", "message": "…" } ]
}
```

To run a case, load every entry of `files` together as one themes folder, with
the built-ins being Chalk and Chalk Dark resolved for the platform. A file's
`json` is its text, which may be invalid JSON on purpose. Then pick `selected`:
the user theme with that identifier if it loaded, otherwise the built-in with
that identifier, otherwise Chalk (the stand-in for a theme that did not load).
Resolve it for each platform. For each requested appearance, it must equal
`expected[platform][appearance]`.

`issues` is everything the load reports **except the audit** (contrast, radius
order, touch target and the rest of `validate()`), in order. That covers decoding
errors, unknown-key and platform-palette warnings, bad values, missing roles
and skipped files. It is the same on every platform, because a bad value in any
`platforms` entry is reported everywhere. A port must match `source` and
`severity` in order. `message` is the reference wording, and matching it exactly is
encouraged but not required.

### `<resolved>`: the canonical resolved theme

```json
{
  "identifier": "user.dusk",
  "name": "Dusk",
  "lockedAppearance": null,
  "appearance": "dark",
  "colors": { "paper": "#15131c", "mediaScrim": "#000000b3", "…": "…" },
  "structure": {
    "radius": { "panel": 0, "row": 0, "control": 2, "pill": 9999, "shell": 20 },
    "border": { "hairline": 1, "emphasis": 2, "focusRing": 2 },
    "spacing": { "xxs": 2, "xs": 4, "sm": 8, "md": 12, "lg": 16, "xl": 24 },
    "typography": {
      "display": { "families": ["IBM Plex Sans"], "design": "sans" },
      "body": { "families": ["IBM Plex Sans"], "design": "sans" },
      "mono": { "families": ["Lilex"], "design": "monospaced" },
      "bodySize": 13,
      "scale": { "caption": 12, "body": 13, "title": 15, "display": 28, "hero": 64 },
      "microLabel": { "size": 12, "weight": "regular", "tracking": 0, "uppercase": false, "role": "mutedText" }
    },
    "touchTarget": 0,
    "usesShadows": false,
    "usesGradientsOnChrome": false
  }
}
```

- `lockedAppearance` is always present: `"light"`, `"dark"` or `null`.
- `appearance` is the appearance actually drawn: the lock if there is one,
  otherwise the appearance requested.
- `colors` has every role, resolved in `appearance` the way the app draws it.
  `mediaLetterbox`, `mediaScrim` and `mediaScrimInk` always come from the
  light table. A role missing from the appearance's table is borrowed from
  the other one. Values are lowercase `#rrggbb`, or `#rrggbbaa` when alpha is
  not 1, with alpha rounded to the nearest of 255 steps.
- Every structural value is stated. Numbers are JSON numbers, and integral values are
  written without a fraction (`13`, not `13.0`), so compare them numerically.
- Keys are sorted and the files are pretty-printed with a trailing newline,
  but compare parsed JSON, not bytes.
