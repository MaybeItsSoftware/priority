"""Check that `Priority --mcp-server` still reaches an MCP server.

This replaces `mcp_parity_check.py`. That harness existed because Priority
shipped two implementations of the same MCP server — one in Swift inside the
app, one in the Rust CLI — and a client could be pointed at either, so a tool
that answered differently in one was a capability the assistant appeared to lose
depending on how it was wired up. It drove both over stdio and diffed their tool
lists, their answers, the files they left on disk, and their HTTP requests.

There is now one implementation. The Swift server is gone; the app bundles the
CLI at `Contents/Helpers/priority` and `--mcp-server` hands the process over to
it (see `Priority/MCPServerShim.swift`). Correctness of the server itself is
`cargo test`'s job.

What is left to check is the seam — that the handover works, and in particular
that a client configuration written *before* this change, naming
`Priority --mcp-server` with credentials in `env`, still gets a working server.
That is the compatibility promise the migration was built on, and nothing else
covers it.

Reads no real data and needs no credentials. Needs a Debug app build.
