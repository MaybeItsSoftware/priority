/**
 * Where a device syncs: the sync server, and the Supabase project whose
 * accounts that server trusts. Takt's own unless "Use a different server"
 * names a self-hosted pair (docs/self-hosting.md). Typed endpoints are read
 * by the Rust core (`core/src/sync/endpoints.rs`), as on the Mac and iPhone.
 *
 * The three travel together because they only work together: the server
 * checks every access token against one Supabase project, so a session from
 * another project gets a token it refuses.
