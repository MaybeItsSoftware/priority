# Sync

Priority's workspace is a local SQLite database on every device. The Mac, the
iPhone and the Android phone each keep a full copy and work offline. Sync
copies row changes between them through one small server (`sync-server/`,
hosted on Railway). The server stores rows and merges them; it knows nothing
about tasks.

The client half is the Rust core's (`core/src/sync.rs`): the outbox, the
cycle's push body and the pulled pages (`core/src/sync/wire.rs`, with the
server's own structs from `takt-sync-rules`), the clock, applying a pull, and
reading a typed server address (`core/src/sync/endpoints.rs`). The Mac and
iPhone (`Sources/TaktSync`) and Android (`mobile/android/data`) keep only the
transport: HTTP, the Supabase token and the long poll, moving bodies the core
made and handing back pages as the server sent them. The Rust CLI syncs
passively: it never talks to the server, but its writes go through the same
triggers, so they sync the next time the app does.

## What is synced

Every row of these tables, keyed by the column shown:

| Table | Key |
| --- | --- |
| `workspaces` | `id` |
| `list_folders` | `id` |
| `task_lists` | `id` |
| `tasks` | `id` |
| `task_metadata` | `taskId` |
| `task_conditions` | `id` |
| `task_dependencies` | `id` |
| `kanban_boards` | `id` |
| `filter_lists` | `id` |
| `dailies` | `id` |
| `daily_contributions` | `id` |
| `focus_sessions` | `id` |
| `focus_queue_items` | `id` |
| `focus_work_blocks` | `id` |
| `focus_awards` | `id` |
| `agent_instructions` | `scope` |
| `themes` | `id` |
| `preferences` | `key` |
| `focus_contexts` | `workspaceId` |

`themes` and `preferences` arrive in `v18_themes_and_preferences`:
`themes(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, json TEXT NOT NULL, updatedAt DATETIME NOT NULL)`
and `preferences(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT, updatedAt DATETIME NOT NULL)`.
They hold the user's theme files and the cross-device choices described in
[themes](themes.md#the-chosen-theme-follows-you). Neither is journalled for undo.

`v19_habit_options` adds five columns to `dailies` — `sourceTaskId TEXT`,
`placementColumn TEXT`, `dropsAtDayEnd BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`,
`expiryRule TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'never'` and `expiresAt DATETIME` — and
reinstalls the `dailies` outbox and journal triggers, which name its columns.
A client that does not know them still syncs: the defaults describe a plain
daily. The Mac (`WorkspaceStore+Habits.swift`) and Android
(`WorkspaceRepositoryHabits.kt`) both move a habit's card between columns
and expire habits, from the same `HabitPolicy`. Each pass writes only the
habit's own `task_metadata` and `dailies` rows, so two devices converge on
the same values. The Habits list a new habit goes in has an id derived from
the workspace (`HabitPolicy.habitsListId`), so two devices that each make
it make one row. Other clients see the result as ordinary rows.

`v20_waiting_follow_ups` adds four columns to `task_metadata` — `waitingOn TEXT`
(who or what a task in the `waiting-on` column waits on), `waitingFollowUpAt
DATETIME` (when to chase it), `waitingFollowUpTaskId TEXT` (the follow-up already
made for it) and `followUpOfTaskId TEXT` (on a follow-up: the task it chases) —
and reinstalls the `task_metadata` outbox and journal triggers. Every client
that runs the follow-up engine (the Mac and Android; see `WaitingFollowUp` in
`Sources/TaktCore` and its Kotlin port) gives the follow-up task the same id,
derived from the source's id and the follow-up time:
`SHA-256("takt.follow-up:<sourceTaskId>:<epoch seconds>")`, its first 16 bytes
formatted as an uppercase UUID with the version-5 and RFC 4122 variant bits set.
Two devices that both make the same follow-up therefore write the same `tasks`
and `task_metadata` rows, which merge rather than duplicate.

`v21_task_dependencies` adds `task_dependencies(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, taskId,
blockedByTaskId, createdAt)`: `taskId` waits on `blockedByTaskId` until that
task is completed or cancelled. Both ends reference `tasks(id) ON DELETE
CASCADE`, so deleting either task deletes the edge, and the tombstone syncs;
an edge that arrives before one of its tasks, or after it was deleted, is an
orphan the pull removes. It is the first migration written for the Rust core
rather than captured from GRDB, and it ends by reinstalling every journal and
outbox trigger (`schema::data::finish`). An edge's id is derived from its two
ends — `SHA-256("takt.dependency:<taskId>:<blockedByTaskId>")`, formatted like
a follow-up's id — so two devices that add the same dependency write one row.
The core refuses an edge that would close a cycle, but two devices offline can
each add half of one; nothing walks the graph beyond that check, so such a
cycle only leaves its tasks blocked (dimmed and sunk) until an edge is
removed. A client older than v21 skips the table's rows on pull, as it skips
any table it does not know. The rules the clients draw from it live in
`core/src/dependencies.rs`.

`v22_matrix_order` adds `matrixRank INTEGER` to `task_metadata`: a task's
place within its matrix quadrant, lowest first, and reinstalls the
`task_metadata` journal and outbox triggers. A quadrant reads ranked tasks
first, by rank, then the unranked in board order. Dropping a task at a point
in a quadrant (`tasks::place_in_matrix`) renumbers the quadrant's tasks from
0 in the order the client drew them, writing only the ranks that change;
moving a task to another quadrant without a point clears its rank, so it
lands after the ranked ones. A client older than v22 drops the column on
pull, as it drops any column it does not know.

`v23_filter_lists` adds `filter_lists(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, workspaceId,
name, icon, colorHex, rulesJSON, sortOrder, createdAt, updatedAt)`: a saved,
named rule set evaluated over every task (`core/src/filter_lists.rs`), which
the sidebar draws under Today, Everything and the inbox. `rulesJSON` is
`{"match":"all"|"any","show":"open"|"done"|"all","rules":[{"field","op","value"}]}`;
a rule a client does not know is skipped when it evaluates rather than
refused, so an older device shows a broader list than a newer one wrote, never
an empty one. Ids are random; there is nothing to merge two devices' filter
lists on. The table is journalled (creating, editing and deleting one is an
undo step) and the migration ends by reinstalling every journal and outbox
trigger, like v21. When two devices' workspaces are merged into the canonical
one (`sync::adopt_workspaces`), filter lists move with the folders and lists.
Today and Everything are definitions shipped in the core, not rows.

`v24_condition_categories` adds `category TEXT` to `task_conditions`: the
heading a condition is filed under ("Location", "Equipment", "Energy"), or
NULL for none. It reinstalls the `task_conditions` journal and outbox
triggers, then files every existing place (`isLocation = 1`) under
"Location" with the journal and the outbox off, as a data step every device
runs for itself, so the backfill is not pushed. `isLocation` stays and stays
authoritative for exclusivity: the core's writes keep it equal to
`category = 'Location'` (filing a condition under Location makes it a place,
filing it anywhere else makes it not one, and making it a place through the
old `save_condition` files it under Location). A client older than v24 drops
the column on pull and still treats places as exclusive; a place it makes
arrives with no category and is shown under Location
(`conditions::effective_category`). Categories are free text, matched
case-insensitively, so "equipment" typed on one device joins "Equipment".

`v25_agent_instructions` adds `agent_instructions(scope TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
text, updatedAt)`: the agent panel's standing instructions
(`core/src/agent_instructions.rs`, `docs/agent-panel.md`), one row per scope.
The key *is* the scope — `account`, `folder:<id>` or `list:<id>` — rather
than a random id, so two devices that each write the account's instructions
write the same row and the merge keeps one of them instead of two rows that
both claim the account. It names no other row by foreign key: a row whose
folder or list is deleted is simply never read back. The table is journalled
(an edit, the agent's included, is an undo step) and the migration ends by
reinstalling every journal and outbox trigger. It syncs because the agent's
tools are the CLI's, which runs wherever the workspace is, and syncing it is
three entries in the table lists; a phone stores the rows and shows none of
them. The Mac's instructions lived in its preferences before v25, and the app
copies them in once, outside the journal (`import_agent_instructions`).

`v26_commitment_missed_stack` adds `stacksMissedFrom DATETIME` to `dailies`:
the start of the local day from which a habit's missed appearances stack
rather than vanish, NULL (every existing row) for vanishing. It reinstalls
every journal and outbox trigger. While it is set, the habit pass keeps the
card in its column while any scheduled day since then has no completed
contribution, and `dailies::log_contribution` records a completion against
the oldest such day rather than today. Only the commitment form sets it
(`commitments::save_commitment`). A client older than v26 drops the column on
pull and treats the habit as vanishing.

`v28_synced_focus_context` syncs `focus_contexts`, the table v27 added for
what holds now: which conditions are on (`conditionIdsJSON`), when they were
said (`conditionsSetAt`), the time available (`availableUntil`), the goal
(`mode`), when the answer lapses (`expiresAt`) and what an expired answer set
aside to offer back (`suggestedIdsJSON`) — one row per workspace, keyed by the
workspace's id, which every paired device shares once adoption has run
(`core/src/focus_context.rs`). The table does not change: the migration
reinstalls the outbox triggers, which now name it, and on a device that is
already paired queues the row it holds, so the next push sends it. It is not
journalled — saying where you are is not an undo step.

It is one answer, so it merges as one: the table is in
`triggers::WHOLE_ROW_TABLES`, and every change to it pushes every column
rather than the ones that moved. The server's per-column merge then gives
each column the same clock, and the last device to say where you are wins
the whole row; half of one device's answer under half of another's would be
neither. `conditionsSetAt` travels with the row, so a context said yesterday
on the phone counts as stale on the Mac (`focus_context_is_stale`). When
workspace adoption folds a device's own workspace into the canonical one,
its context comes along if the canonical workspace has none or it was saved
more recently, its conditions renamed to the canonical workspace's
conditions of the same name; otherwise it goes. The Mac, the iPhone and
Android read and write the row through the core, and each phone moved the
context its own settings held into it once, when the workspace had none.
The server needed nothing: it stores whatever tables it is sent. A client
older than v28 skips the table's rows on pull, as it skips any table it does
not know.

`v29_daily_contribution_skips` adds `skippedAt DATETIME` to
`daily_contributions`: when a day's appearance of a habit was set aside
without being done, NULL (every existing row) for not skipped. It reinstalls
every journal and outbox trigger. Cancelling a commitment's subtask writes it
(`commitments::skip_instead_of_cancelling`) on the day its showing appearance
belongs to. The habit pass reads a skipped day as settled, like a completed
one, so it is neither carried nor owed when missed appearances stack, but it
is not a completion: streaks, counts and `completedAt` are untouched. Two
devices' rows for the same day merge by keeping the earlier `skippedAt`, as
they keep the earlier `completedAt`. A client older than v29 drops the
column on pull and sees the day as not done.

`v31_link_details` adds `linkDetailsJSON TEXT` to `task_metadata`: a JSON
object keyed by link address of the name and file type the link picker knew
(`{"<url>": {"title": "Budget", "mimeType": "…"}}`), NULL for nothing known.
The addresses themselves stay in `externalLinksJSON`, so the two columns
merge independently; a name whose address is gone is ignored and pruned on
the next link write (`core/src/links.rs`). It reinstalls every journal and
outbox trigger. A client older than v31 drops the column on pull and draws
its links from the address alone. See `docs/links.md`.

`v32_follow_up_repeat` adds two columns to `task_metadata`:
`waitingFollowUpEveryDays INTEGER` (chase again every so many days, 1 to 365,
after a follow-up is completed; NULL is once) and `waitingFollowUpCount
INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (how many follow-ups this spell of waiting has
made, which numbers the next: "Follow up #2 with Sam: …"). Completing a
follow-up moves its source's `waitingFollowUpAt` on in the same step, so the
next follow-up's id — still SHA-256 of the source and the time — is the same
on every device that makes it. Each column merges on its own like the rest
of the row. It reinstalls every journal and outbox trigger. A client older
than v32 drops both on pull, makes unnumbered follow-ups, and never moves the
time on; a repeat set elsewhere still applies when a newer client completes
the follow-up. See `core/src/waiting.rs`.

`v33_recurrence_series` adds `task_metadata.seriesTaskId TEXT`: the id of
the first occurrence of the repeating task this one belongs to, NULL when a
task is its own series (every task written before it). The next turn and a
"keep both" copy are given the series of the task they come from, so a
priority set on one open occurrence can be written to every open occurrence
of the series in the same step — the newest one wins. It merges on its own
like the rest of the row and reinstalls every journal and outbox trigger. A
client older than v33 drops it on pull and sets a priority on the one
occurrence only. See `core/src/editor.rs`.

The following are not synced: the undo journal (`undo_control`, `change_log`), the FTS index
(rebuilt by its own triggers as synced rows land), `grdb_migrations`, and the
sync tables themselves. Day-log files stay per device. Theme *files* do
too, but their text travels as `themes` rows (the Mac mirrors its themes
folder into the table, see [themes](themes.md#the-chosen-theme-follows-you)).

## Local schema (`v17_sync`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sync_control (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  recording INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- 1 once the device is signed in
  applying  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0);  -- 1 while remote rows are written
INSERT INTO sync_control (id) VALUES (0);

CREATE TABLE sync_outbox (seq INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  tableName TEXT NOT NULL, rowId TEXT NOT NULL,
  operation TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'insert' | 'update' | 'delete'
  changedJSON TEXT,                 -- update only: JSON array of column names (may hold nulls; ignore them)
  changedAtMs INTEGER NOT NULL);    -- wall clock when the trigger fired

CREATE TABLE sync_state (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  deviceId TEXT NOT NULL, cursor INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  hlc TEXT, serverURL TEXT, canonicalWorkspaceId TEXT,
  needsSnapshot INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, lastSyncedAt DATETIME);
```

Each synced table has `sync_outbox_<table>_{insert,update,delete}` AFTER
triggers, guarded by
`WHEN (SELECT recording FROM sync_control WHERE id = 0) = 1 AND (SELECT applying FROM sync_control WHERE id = 0) = 0`.
They use plain SQL only. They must never call an application-registered
function, because the CLI and `sqlite3` write to the same file without one. Like the
undo triggers, they name their columns, so **any later migration that adds or
removes a column on a synced table must reinstall them**. Migrations live in
the Rust core; `core/src/schema/triggers.rs` generates both kinds of trigger
from a table's current columns.

An undo is ordinary inserts and updates, so it syncs like any other edit.

## Hybrid logical clock

An HLC is the string `"<ms:013d>-<counter:04d>-<deviceId>"`. Because every part is
fixed width, plain string comparison orders HLCs correctly. A device keeps its
last HLC in `sync_state.hlc`. To stamp a change made at wall time `w`:
`ms = max(last.ms, w)`. The counter is `last.counter + 1` if `ms` equals `last.ms`,
and `0` otherwise. When it receives a row, the device advances its clock past
the row's HLC in the same way.

## Wire protocol (JSON over HTTPS)

Accounts are **Supabase Auth** users. The apps sign in with Supabase itself
(email and password, Google, or Apple), and Supabase handles confirming
emails and resetting passwords. Every request but `/health` then sends:

- `Authorization: Bearer <Supabase access token>`. The server checks its
  signature against the project's published keys and takes the account from
  its `sub`. An expired token gets `401`; the app refreshes it with Supabase
  and retries, and only a failed refresh means "signed out — sign in again".
- `X-Priority-Device: <uuid>`, the device's own id, made once and kept.
  Required on `/v1/push` (every write records its device); used elsewhere to
  mark the current device.

A value is a JSON `null`, number or string, exactly as SQLite stores it. Dates
are GRDB's `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"` text in UTC, and booleans are `0`/`1`.

### Devices and the account

- `POST /v1/devices` `{ "id", "name", "platform" }` records the device on the
  account. Sent after every sign-in; a device that was on another account
  moves to this one.
- `GET /v1/account` returns `{ "accountId", "email", "devices": [{ "id",
  "name", "platform", "createdAt", "lastSeenAt", "current" }] }`.
- `POST /v1/sign-out` takes the calling device off the list. The app signs out
  of Supabase itself and keeps its workspace.
- `POST /v1/account/delete` deletes the account's rows, its devices and the
  Supabase user. The app asks the user to confirm first. Every device keeps
  its local copy.

### Signing in on the Mac and iPhone

`Sources/TaktSync` holds both apps' half. `SyncServer` names the
Supabase project (its URL and publishable key) and the redirect,
`takt://auth-callback`, which has to be on the project's allowed
redirect URLs. `SyncEndpoints` is the server and project in use: those
defaults, or a self-hosted pair entered under "Use a different server"
(on the Mac and Android) and kept apart from the sign-in, through signing
out. Changing it signs the device out first. See
[self-hosting](self-hosting.md).

- **Email and password**: sign in, or create an account. When the project
  asks for confirmed emails, signing up says "check your email". "Forgot
  password?" calls Supabase's `recover`. The emailed link opens the app, which
  signs in and asks for a new password.
- **Google**: Supabase's web flow in `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, coming back
  on `takt://auth-callback`.
- **Apple**: on the iPhone, the native sheet. The ID token and a hashed nonce
  go to Supabase's `id_token` grant. The Mac is signed without a provisioning
  profile, so it can't hold the Sign in with Apple entitlement and uses the
  web flow, as for Google.

The Supabase session lives in the Keychain, through the SDK's own
`KeychainLocalStorage`, readable after first unlock so a background refresh
can sync. Before each request the transport asks the client for a token,
which refreshes it first if it has expired. A `401` refreshes once and
retries. A refresh Supabase refuses is "signed out". A refresh that fails
because the device is offline is only a failed cycle.

The device id is a UUID, made the first time and kept in the Keychain across
sign-outs. A device signed in under the old server-issued accounts keeps its
id, drops the old token, and asks to sign in again.

### `POST /v1/push`
Request:
```json
{ "changes": [
  { "table": "tasks", "id": "<uuid>", "op": "upsert", "hlc": "<hlc>",
    "values": { "title": "Buy milk", "updatedAt": "2026-10-02 09:00:00.000" } },
  { "table": "tasks", "id": "<uuid>", "op": "delete", "hlc": "<hlc>" } ] }
```
Response: `{ "accepted": <n>, "cursor": <server seq after applying> }`

For each change, the server resolves it against the stored row
`(data, colHlc, deleted, deletedHlc)`:
- **upsert:** for each column, the incoming value wins if its HLC is greater than
  `colHlc[col]`, or if the column has none. If the row is deleted and
  `hlc > deletedHlc`, the row comes back: `deleted = false`, and the incoming
  columns are applied over the old data. That is what undoing a delete looks
  like. If `hlc <= deletedHlc`, the change is ignored.
- **delete:** the row is deleted if `hlc` is greater than every `colHlc`. Then
  `deleted = true` and `deletedHlc = hlc`.
- If anything changed, the row gets a new `seq` from one global sequence.
  `lastDeviceId` records the pusher, for diagnostics only.

Pushing the same change twice changes nothing.

### `GET /v1/changes?since=<seq>&limit=<n>&wait=<seconds>`
Response:
```json
{ "rows": [ { "table": "tasks", "id": "<uuid>", "deleted": false,
              "values": { "...every column..." }, "hlc": "<max colHlc>" } ],
  "cursor": 1234, "hasMore": false }
```
The response holds the rows whose `seq > since`, in `seq` order, **including
rows the caller itself last wrote**. Skipping those looks like a free
saving, but it's wrong: a row the caller last wrote can still hold another
device's earlier edit to a different column that the caller has never seen.
Re-applying your own row is harmless. It also returns the cursor to resume
from. If there is nothing to send and `wait > 0` (at most 25), the request
waits for new rows, woken through Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`.

### `GET /health`
Returns `200 {"ok":true}`.

## A client sync cycle

1. **First cycle only:** if `needsSnapshot = 1`:
   - Set `recording = 1` and add an `insert` outbox entry for every existing
     row in the synced tables, in parent-first table order.
   - Clear `needsSnapshot`.
   - Pull before pushing (step 3, then step 2).
2. **Push:**
   - Read the outbox in `seq` order and merge entries for the same row. The
     merged op is `delete` if the last entry is a delete; otherwise `upsert`,
     with every column if any entry was an insert, or else the union of the
     changed columns.
   - Read the values from the **live row** at push time.
   - Stamp each change with an HLC from its newest `changedAtMs`, in that
     order, starting from the stored clock; the clock is stored again when
     the batch is acknowledged.
   - Send them in batches of 100. After each accepted batch, delete the outbox
     entries up to the batch's highest `seq`.
3. **Pull:**
   - Fetch pages until `hasMore` is false.
   - Apply **all of them in one transaction** with `applying = 1` and
     `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys = ON`:
     - Upsert: `UPDATE` if the row exists, else `INSERT`. Never use `INSERT OR REPLACE`, because a replace deletes, and a delete cascades.
     - Delete: `DELETE`.
     - Skip any row that still has an outbox entry, so a local edit made
       during the cycle is not overwritten. The next cycle resolves it.
     - If an insert hits a unique conflict on another key
       (`daily_contributions(dailyId, dayKey)`,
       `tasks(sourceSystem, sourceId)`, `task_lists(workspaceId, systemRole)`),
       the **smaller id wins on every device**, so two devices that made a row
       for the same key settle on the same one instead of each deleting its own.
       If the local row is smaller, keep it and queue a `delete` outbox entry for
       the incoming id. Otherwise delete the local row (recording on) and insert
       the incoming one. For `daily_contributions` the winner then takes
       `MAX(secondsLogged)` and the earlier non-null `completedAt` of the two,
       with recording on. Inbox rivals (`task_lists`) are the one exception:
       the incoming Inbox always wins and inherits the local Inbox's tasks.
   - Then set `applying = 0` and run **workspace adoption**.
   - Then delete orphans until `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` is clean. A task whose
     list was deleted on another device is removed, and its tombstone syncs.
   - Commit, then advance `cursor` and the HLC.
4. **Workspace adoption:**
   - `canonicalWorkspaceId` is the first workspace id a device ever receives
     from the server. If the server has none, it is the device's own workspace.
   - For any other local workspace:
     - Move the tasks in its Inbox into the canonical Inbox, then delete its Inbox.
     - Re-point its folders, lists and conditions to the canonical workspace.
     - Keep its `focus_contexts` row, under the canonical id, if the canonical
       workspace has none or this one was saved more recently; then drop it.
     - Delete it.
   - These writes run with recording on, so they sync.

When it runs: when the app comes to the foreground, 2 s after the last local write,
in a long-poll loop while the app is in front, and in background refresh.

## Server storage (Postgres)

In the `sync` schema of the Supabase project's database, which the Data API
doesn't expose; RLS is on with no policies besides. `account_id` is the
Supabase user's id.

```sql
CREATE TABLE devices (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, account_id UUID NOT NULL, name TEXT,
  platform TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ);
CREATE SEQUENCE row_seq;
CREATE TABLE rows (account_id UUID NOT NULL, table_name TEXT, row_id TEXT,
  data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}', col_hlc JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false, deleted_hlc TEXT, seq BIGINT NOT NULL,
  last_device_id UUID, PRIMARY KEY (account_id, table_name, row_id));
CREATE INDEX rows_account_seq ON rows(account_id, seq);
```

`seq` is one sequence across all accounts, so an account's cursor has gaps;
it only has to rise. Pushes are serialised per account by an advisory lock,
which keeps each account's `seq` order its commit order.
