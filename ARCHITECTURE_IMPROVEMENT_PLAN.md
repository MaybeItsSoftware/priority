# Architecture Improvement Plan

This document captures the structural problems in Priority as it stands today and the staged work needed to resolve them. It is referenced from `CLAUDE.md` and should be kept current — when a phase lands, mark it done; when scope changes, edit here rather than scattering decisions across PRs.

## Guiding Principles

- **Decompose along responsibilities, not file size.** Splitting one 800-LOC file into four 200-LOC files that all import each other is not progress.
- **Push state down, not coordination up.** `AppCoordinator` should orchestrate, not own; managers should own their state and expose intent-level APIs.
- **Plugin identity must not leak.** No `isUsingOfflineStore`-style booleans outside `Plugins/`. Switching is a plugin-layer concern.
- **One source of truth per fact.** No duplicated computed properties across `AppCoordinator` and `TaskRepository`.
- **Tests are part of the contract.** New seams introduced by this plan ship with tests; existing untested code is not refactored without a test first.

## Current State

Last audited 2026-08-18. Figures are from the working tree at that point, not
from when a phase landed — the previous version of this section still described
`AppCoordinator` as "2,205 LOC across 9 files" and cited line numbers in
`AppCoordinator+TaskScoping.swift` and `+StateAndLifecycle.swift`, files that no
longer exist. If you are reading a claim here that the code contradicts, the
code is right; fix this section.

| | Then (plan written) | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `AppCoordinator` | 2,205 LOC / 9 files | **525 LOC / 2 files** (`AppCoordinator.swift`, `+ServiceHosts.swift`) |
| `PopoverView.swift` | 2,068 LOC | 1,461 LOC |
| `SettingsView.swift` | 1,473 LOC | 526 LOC |
| `KanbanManager.swift` | 778 LOC | 625 LOC (rules and selection moved to `TaktCore`) |
| `KeyboardShortcutRouter.swift` | 1,011 LOC | 923 LOC across 2 files; gates, sequences and guards in `TaktCore` |
| MCP implementations | 3 (Swift, Python, Rust) | **1** (the Rust CLI, bundled in the app) |
| How the app gets `TaktCore` | compiled its sources | **links the package product** |
| Test count | — | **1,441 SPM + 129 cargo** (last audited 2026-10-07) |
| SwiftLint in CI | never ran | runs (non-strict); the standing warning count lives in `TODO.md` |

Phases 0–5 are complete. What follows is the open list.

Each open finding below is either *partly addressed* (with what remains stated)
or *decided* (with the reason it has not been acted on). None is a bare "this is
bad" — if one reads that way it has gone stale, which is how this section got
into the state described above.

## Open Findings

### 1. `KeyboardShortcutRouter.handle` is a single ~950-line function

**Superseded.** The router went with the popover, and the desktop workspace
dispatches through `WorkspaceCommandCatalog` instead. The pieces below outlived
it unused and were deleted in phase 5 of `docs/zed-overhaul-plan.md`; only
`ShortcutKeyToken.nameByKeyCode` and `ShortcutReference.display(token:)`
remain, because the catalogue spells and renders keys with them. What follows
is the record of what they found.

**Mostly addressed.** Three pure pieces are out, in `TaktCore` and tested:

- `ShortcutKeyToken` — the token spelling (`"cmd+k"`, `"shift+enter"`), next to
  `ConfigurableShortcutAction.defaultBinding`, which has to agree with it.
  Writing its test found a dead binding: `rootFilter7` defaulted to `"comma"`,
  which no key press produced.
- `ShortcutGate` — the five modal gates (onboarding, the plugin-selection
  dialog, a running focus session, the focus prompt) *and their precedence*,
  which is the actual rule. 18 tests.
- `ShortcutSequenceBuffer` — the two-key state machine. One character of state
  that was read and written at nine scattered points; a buffer left standing
  swallows the next key press with no visible cause. 17 tests.
- `ShortcutResolver` — an ordered table of every binding and the conditions it
  is live under. The router no longer states its guards; it asks the table, so
  the two cannot drift.

**That table found a real bug.** `shadowedRules()` asks whether any rule is
covered everywhere by an earlier rule for the same action, and it was: the
`moveTaskUp` / `moveTaskDown` branches ran unguarded *above* the Daily view's
block, which binds the same gesture to reordering a daily. So in the Daily view
Cmd+↑/↓ silently reordered a task in the list underneath, and the Daily handler
was unreachable. Fixed by moving the general pair below the Daily block; the
test asserts no rule is shadowed.

A second audit, `deadBindings()`, looks for a binding that wins in no context at
all. There are none — and it corrected this document, which used to claim
`moveTaskUp`'s `cmd+k` alias was simply unreachable. It is not, quite:
`openCommandPalette` claims `cmd+k` first but only while nothing has keyboard
focus, so the alias survives in exactly the situation nobody would use it —
mid-typing, where it reorders the task behind the field. Both halves are
long-standing behaviour and changing either is a user-facing call, so
`testCmdKReachesTheCommandPaletteExceptWhileTyping` pins what is true instead.

**Still open:** the dispatch bodies. `handle` is under the file-length limit now
(the performing half moved to `KeyboardShortcutRouter+Support.swift`) but still
carries `// swiftlint:disable ... cyclomatic_complexity` — measured complexity
182 against a limit of 25. What remains is 60 branches each reaching a different
manager. Turning those into an `AppAction` enum is the next step, and it is now
a much safer one: the guards are already tested, so a mistake shows up as a
resolver test failure rather than a silently dead key.

### 2. Two shadow copies of the plugin model types

**Route 2 has started, and the premise behind this whole finding is gone.**

`TaktCore`'s sources moved to `Sources/TaktCore`, and the Xcode target
now *links* the package product instead of compiling the same files. That was
~46 files gaining an `import TaktCore` and ~300 declarations gaining
`public` — all compile-checked, and the target has no `@Observable` types, so
the silent "stops updating" failure mode did not apply.

The consequence is larger than the move. **`TaktAppLogic` and
`TaktPlugins` can now `import TaktCore`.** That import used to break the
app build, because the same sources are compiled straight into the app where no
such module existed — the constraint this document called "the one-file-one-target
rule" and treated as fixed. It is not fixed; it only held while the app compiled
the sources. Three things followed immediately:

- `OfflineReplayPolicy.swift` moved into `Sources/TaktCore`, ending the
  exile this document used as its example of the rule.
- The due-date parsing moved out of `CheckvistTask` into
  `TaktCore.DueDateParsing`, so the real model and the shadow now share it
  rather than the shadow re-deriving forty lines of date formats.
- `TaskListViewModel` became reachable — see finding 3.

**Still open:** `applogic-support/AppLogicSharedTypes.swift` and
`plugin-tests-support/PluginModelStubs.swift` still exist. Deleting them needs
`TaktPlugins` to be linked by the app as well, and that is blocked on three
plugin files that name app-only services (`CheckvistSession`,
`CheckvistTaskRepository`, `ObsidianSyncService`, `GoogleOAuthLoopbackReceiver`
— which is what `PluginModelStubs` fakes). Only `ObsidianSyncService` imports
AppKit; the others are Foundation-only, so most of that is movable. Until then
`SharedTypeDriftTests` keeps the two declarations honest, and the exclude lists
are shorter but not gone.

### 3. Managers with no tests

The pattern is now established five times: take the pure decision out, make it
generic or parameterised so it needs no app types, put it in `TaktCore`, and
leave the manager gathering inputs and applying results.

**Done since the audit:**

- `KanbanFilter` — membership and ordering. 23 tests.
- `KanbanSelection` — the other half of `KanbanManager`: which card is selected
  and which column has focus. Works on a grid of task ids per column, so it
  knows nothing about `CheckvistTask` or how the board filtered itself. 26
  tests. It also fixed a real inefficiency — `nextKanbanTask` used to re-filter
  every column to resolve focus and then again to read the one it settled on.
- `PendingSyncQueue` and `IntegrationLinkStore` — the Obsidian sync queue and
  the calendar link map out of `IntegrationCoordinator`. 22 tests. (The MCP half
  of that coordinator turned out to be already factored into
  `CoreLogic/MCPClientConfig.swift` with tests, so it needed nothing.)
- **`TaskListViewModel`** — the one this document called the highest-value and
  hardest target. A `TaskListViewModelHost` seam in the shape of
  `TaskMutationHost`/`SyncHost` replaced the five app-only managers it named
  concretely; every member of that protocol is a read-only scalar, which is why
  it was worth doing at all. 12 tests, including the two that matter:
  `cacheVersion` is bumped on invalidation, and — the subtle one — reading a
  *clean* cache still registers an observation dependency. That second test was
  verified to fail when `_ = cacheVersion` is removed, which is the whole reason
  the line exists and is invisible by eye.

**Writing those tests found a crash.** `TimerStore.rolledUpElapsedByTaskId`
recursed down the child tree with no cycle guard, and memoised only *after*
returning — so a cycle in the parent chain never terminated. Not a wrong number:
a stack overflow, `SIGSEGV`, from data that arrives over the network. Four
ancestor walks had already been guarded during the audit; this one was missed
because it walks *children* rather than parents. Fixed, with tests for the
two-node cycle, a longer one, and a self-parented task.

**Still zero coverage:** `IntegrationCoordinator`'s AppKit-bound half (the
Obsidian and Google Calendar flows), the router's dispatch bodies, and every
view.

### 4. SwiftLint's standing warnings

The live count, and what each warning is, is kept in **`TODO.md`** ("Known-good
backlog"), the single place the number lives; the figures that used to sit here
(thirteen, then nine, then the workspace files' arrival) are now history and
the per-file list went stale every time one was fixed. What remains after the
2026-10-07 cleanup is length and complexity on the known large files only —
none of them a new kind, none suppressed.

CI runs `swiftlint lint` without `--strict`, so these are advisory and errors
block. Don't add to the list; don't suppress it either — every warning
introduced while doing the work above was fixed rather than accepted.

### 5. Day-log rotation

The read amplification is fixed — `DailyLogService.reloadFromDisk()` now stats
both files before decoding anything. What remains is that `daylog.jsonl` still
grows without bound and is held entirely in memory. That is a deliberate
trade (every projection needs the full history, since a reopen can cancel a
completion from any earlier day), and a few thousand events a year is nothing.
Revisit if someone's log reaches a size where the launch-time `loadAll` is
noticeable.

### 6. The in-process MCP server — done

**Closed.** `Takt/Plugins/MCP/MCPServer.swift` (1,760 LOC) is deleted, along
with `scripts/mcp_parity_check.py` (614 LOC), the `mcp-parity` CI job, and
`CoreLogic/MCPMessageFraming.swift` (161 LOC plus its tests), which existed only
to frame that server's stdio.

The one thing keeping it alive was never a capability the CLI lacked — the
parity check proved all nineteen tools agreed on answers, files written and HTTP
requests made. It was that MCP client configurations already on users' disks name
`/Applications/Priority.app/Contents/MacOS/Priority --mcp-server`.

So the app ships the CLI instead. `scripts/bundle_cli.sh`, from an Xcode build
phase, cargo-builds it and installs it at `Contents/Helpers/takt`, signed
with the app. `TaktEntryPoint.main()` checks for `--mcp-server` before
`MainApp.main()` and hands the process to `MCPServerShim.run()`, which `execv`s
the helper — so a process that only speaks JSON-RPC on stdio never initialises
AppKit, and there is no supervision to get wrong.

Existing configurations keep working untouched, and largely because the CLI was
already built for it: `cli/src/main.rs` accepts the bare `--mcp-server` flag,
and `cli/src/config.rs` puts the environment above its own config file — which
is exactly where a client configuration puts credentials.

Two costs, both deliberate:

- **Building the app now needs cargo.** `TAKT_SKIP_CLI_BUNDLE=1` opts out
  and produces an app with no MCP server; `scripts/build_dmg.sh` refuses to
  package a bundle missing the helper. `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` had to go
  to `NO`, because cargo writes outside any declarable output.
- **`CLAUDE.md`'s rule changed.** "Nothing in `Takt/` may reference it"
  became "…except the `--mcp-server` shim, which execs the bundled helper". The
  app *runs* the CLI; it still shares no source with it.

What replaced the parity harness is `scripts/mcp_smoke_check.py`, which is a
different question: `cargo test` covers the server, and the smoke check covers
the seam — that both spellings reach it and expose the same nineteen tools, and
specifically that an old-style invocation with credentials in `env` still gets a
working server. Plus `MCPHelperLocator` in `TaktCore`, 12 tests, for the
search order and its diagnostic.

## History: the phased plan

Phases 0–4 are complete; Phase 5 is partly done and partly deferred on purpose.
Kept in full because the *reasoning* behind each move is the useful part — why a
file sits where it does, and which constraint put it there. The open work is in
"Open Findings" above, not here.

Order mattered: each phase removed blockers for the next.

### Phase 0 — Safety net (prerequisite)

Before refactoring `AppCoordinator` we need a regression harness for the behaviour we're about to move.

- [x] Add integration-style tests for `TaskRepository`: load, mutate, reorder, switch list, switch online/offline. Use the existing `OfflineTaskSyncPlugin` plus a fake `CheckvistSyncPlugin` to drive both branches.
- [x] Add tests for reordering paths (`ReorderQueueTests`). Undo paths gained coverage in step 3.2 once `UndoService` was extracted behind the `UndoActionPerforming` protocol — see `applogic-tests/UndoServiceTests.swift`. `taskAction` and the rest of the coordinator-level mutation orchestration gained direct coverage in step 3.8, once `TaskMutationService` and `SyncService` moved into `TaktAppLogic` behind the host protocols — see `applogic-tests/TaskMutationServiceTests.swift` and `applogic-tests/SyncServiceTests.swift`.
- [x] Add a test for cache invalidation: mutate `tasks`, `availableLists`, `priorityTaskIdsByParentId`, assert `TaskListViewModel.cache` rebuilds (this will reveal the missing `availableLists` `didSet`).

### Phase 1 — De-duplicate plugin-switch state

Concrete, low-risk; removes the most-cited leak.

- [x] Move `isUsingOfflineStore`, `activeCredentials`, `activeSyncPlugin` to a single owner. Renamed to `canSyncRemotely` on `TaskRepository` (inverted boolean so the offline plugin no longer leaks into the public name); the duplicates in `AppCoordinator.swift` (`activeCredentials`) and `AppCoordinator+TaskScoping.swift` (`isUsingOfflineStore`) now forward to the repository.
- [x] Replace `if isUsingOfflineStore` callsites with intent-revealing methods on the repository — `canSyncRemotely`. `AppCoordinator+TaskSync.swift` and `SettingsView.swift` were updated. (Note: `hasCredentials` / `hasListSelection` / `canAttemptLogin` are still computed-property duplicates between `AppCoordinator+TaskScoping.swift` and `TaskRepository.swift`; left as-is because the plan didn't name them and Phase 3 will eat them when AppCoordinator decomposes.)
- [x] Remove the `manager.isUsingOfflineStore` reach from `NativeCheckvistSyncPlugin+Settings.swift:273`. Replaced with a direct `manager.listId.isEmpty` check, since the workspace caption only cares whether the user has picked a list.

### Phase 2 — Unify cache invalidation

Goal: one mechanism, no missed invalidations.

- [x] Replaced `onCacheRelevantChange` callbacks with a single `CacheInvalidationBus` (`Takt/CacheInvalidationBus.swift`). Producers (`TaskRepository`, `NavigationState`, `KanbanManager`, `QuickEntryManager`, `TimerManager`, `StartDateManager`, `FocusSessionManager`) take the bus at init and call `bus.invalidate()` from their `didSet`s. The lone subscriber today (`AppCoordinator`) registers once in `setupChildCallbacks` and routes into `TaskListViewModel.invalidateCaches()`. The bus's `init` is `nonisolated` so `@MainActor` managers can keep a `CacheInvalidationBus()` default value on the parameter.
- [x] Audited every `var` on `TaskRepository` and `AppCoordinator`. Added `didSet` for `availableLists` and `isNetworkReachable` (both fire the bus). `checkvistIntegrationEnabled` also fires the bus from `didSet`, so `setupChildCallbacks` no longer reaches into `invalidateCaches()` from its callback. Vars that don't drive task-visibility caches (`isLoading`, `errorMessage`, `lastUndo`, the auth-credential vars whose downstream effect already routes through `tasks`/priority-queue reload) are intentionally exempt and remain unhooked. The previously-XCTExpectFailure'd cases in `TaskRepositoryCacheInvalidationTests` now pass without the wrapper.
- [x] Removed the per-manager `onCacheRelevantChange` properties and the AppCoordinator-side `currentParentId` setter no longer calls `invalidateCaches()` (NavigationState fires the bus from its own `didSet`).

### Phase 3 — Decompose AppCoordinator

Phase 0 must be complete; without tests this is too dangerous.

Target shape:

- `AppCoordinator` shrinks to lifecycle wiring + composition (≤200 LOC).
- Behaviour moves to dedicated services consumed by views directly via `@Environment` / `@Observable`:
  - `TaskMutationService` ← `+TaskMutations`, `+QuickAdd`, `+Undo` (one undo stack, owned here). **Done (steps 3.2 + 3.4):**
    - **Undo half (step 3.2):** split out into `Takt/UndoService.swift` (owns `lastAction` and the rewind switch, replacing the misplaced `TaskRepository.lastUndo` slot). Depends on the new `UndoActionPerforming` protocol rather than `AppCoordinator` directly, which let it move into `TaktAppLogic` — `applogic-tests/UndoServiceTests.swift` covers record/clear and the rewind dispatch for every `UndoableAction` case (10 new tests). `+Undo.swift` is deleted.
    - **Mutation half (step 3.4):** new `Takt/TaskMutationService.swift` owns mark-done / reopen / invalidate / `taskAction`, `updateTask`, `addTask`, `addTaskAsChild`, `deleteTask`, `createNextOccurrence`, and the QuickAdd flow (`beginQuickAddEntry`, `setQuickAddSpecificLocationToCurrentTask`, `submitQuickAddTask`). `+TaskMutations.swift` and `+QuickAdd.swift` are forwarding shims; the recurrence convenience accessors (`recurrenceRule(for:)`, `setRecurrenceRule`, `clearRecurrenceRule`) stay in `+TaskMutations.swift` since they're already one-liners over `recurrence`.
    - **Promoted to AppLogic (step 3.8).** Both `TaskMutationService` and `SyncService` now depend on `TaskMutationHost` / `SyncHost` (`Takt/TaskServiceHosts.swift`) instead of holding a `weak var coordinator: AppCoordinator?`. The UI-bound behaviour they used to inline — the `NSHapticFeedbackManager` + `withAnimation` completion sequence, the kanban column maths, the recurrence rule store, the `TimerElapsedReassignmentPolicy` remap — is expressed as behaviour the host performs, so it lives in `AppCoordinator+ServiceHosts.swift` (the only app-only half of the split) while the services compile into `TaktAppLogic`. `applogic-tests/TaskMutationServiceTests.swift` (20 tests) and `applogic-tests/SyncServiceTests.swift` (14 tests) drive them against `StubTaskServiceHost`, covering `taskAction` rollback, the optimistic add/delete paths, offline queueing, the recurrence hand-off, and offline replay. Writing them surfaced a real defect: `TaskRepository.init`'s `pendingOfflineWorkStore` default ignored the injected `defaults`, so the offline queue always went to `UserDefaults.standard`.
      - `OfflineReplayPolicy.swift` lives at `Sources/TaktCore/OfflineReplayPolicy.swift`. It spent a while at the app root because `TaktAppLogic` could not `import TaktCore` then (its sources were also compiled straight into the Xcode app, where `TaktCore` wasn't a module); once the app started *linking* the package product instead, the import resolved on both sides and the file moved back into `TaktCore`, where `corelogic-tests` covers it.
    - AppCoordinator still exposes the original method names as forwarding shims so existing keybindings, `CommandExecutor`, and view call sites keep working — those move in the forwarding cull.
  - `TaskNavigationService` ← `+Navigation`, `+TaskScoping`. **Partly done (step 3.3):** new `Takt/TaskNavigationService.swift` owns the navigation actions (next/prev, enter/exit, navigate-to, clamp) and the four root-task view-switch operations (`setRootTaskView`, `cycleRootTaskView`, `cycleRootScopeFilter`, `selectRootScopeFilter`), wrapping the pure-logic `TaskNavigationCoordinator` struct. `+Navigation.swift` is now a forwarding shim; the four moved methods in `+TaskScoping.swift` are forwarders too. `TaskRepository.navigationCoordinator` is gone — the service holds its own logic instance. **Not yet moved out of `+TaskScoping.swift`:** the connection-state derivations (`hasCredentials`, `canAttemptLogin`, `checkvistConnectionState`, `canSyncRemotely`), priority-on-current-task mutations (`setPriorityForCurrentTask` etc.), plugin/MCP view-helpers, and the cache/badge accessors. Those belong to later steps (`SyncService`, `TaskMutationService`) or to view-side cleanup.
  - `SyncService` ← `+TaskSync`, `+ReorderingAndTiming` reorder-flush logic. **Done (step 3.5):** new `Takt/SyncService.swift` owns the network-facing surface — login, `fetchTopTask`, list management (`fetchLists`, `loadCheckvistLists`, `switchCheckvistList`, `createCheckvistListAndSwitch`, `mergeOpenTasksBetweenLists`, `selectList`, `uploadOfflineTasksToCheckvist`), the offline-mutation flush, and the reorder/move surface (`moveTask` + per-view strategies, the reorder queue lifecycle, `indentTask`, `unindentTask`). `+TaskSync.swift` is now a 45-line forwarding shim. `+ReorderingAndTiming.swift` is a mixed file: forwarders for the reorder/indent surface, plus the helpers that *didn't* move because other services still call them through the coordinator (`subtreeBlockRange`, the timer/cache roll-up accessors, `executeCommandInput`, the date-resolver helpers). Renaming or splitting that residual file belongs to the post-cull cleanup.
  - `LifecycleController` ← `+StateAndLifecycle` setup/teardown. **Done (step 3.1):** new `Takt/LifecycleController.swift` owns the cache-bus subscription, repository/manager-callback wiring, and the network-monitor lifecycle. AppCoordinator constructs it in `init` and calls `lifecycle.start()`; `reachabilityMonitor` stays on AppCoordinator so the nonisolated `deinit` can stop it without an actor hop. The four other concerns previously crammed into `+StateAndLifecycle.swift` (priority-queue forwarding, loading helpers, keychain bootstrap, onboarding dialogs) remain in that extension for now — they belong to later services in this phase.
- ~~Forwarding properties on `AppCoordinator` are deleted; views read from the relevant service directly.~~ **Method forwarders culled (step 3.6); property cull complete (step 3.7).** Final batch landed: `listId`, `errorMessage`, `username`, `remoteKey`, `availableLists`, `isLoading`, `taskEisenhowerLevels`, `activeCredentials`, and the unused `usernameLower` — all `TaskRepository`-owned, all deleted. Views go through `@Environment(TaskRepository.self) var repository`; non-view callers (`CommandExecutor`, `KeyboardShortcutRouter`, `MenuBarController`, `LifecycleController`, the `AppCoordinator+*` extensions) read via `manager.repository.X` / `coordinator.repository.X` / `repository.X`. `SyncService` and `TaskMutationService` were also narrowed in the same pass — they now take a strong `TaskRepository` field in their initializer (matching `TaskNavigationService`'s shape) instead of routing every forwarder hop through the weak coordinator reference. Two SwiftUI bindings in `NativeCheckvistSyncPlugin+Settings.swift` (the username and remote-key fields) needed explicit `Binding(get:set:)` wrappers because `repository` is a `let` on `AppCoordinator` — the keypath-derived `$manager.repository.username` projection isn't writable.

### Phase 3 outcome (step 3.7 — property forwarder cull, started)

The incremental migration path is now proven end-to-end:
- **Three `NavigationState`-owned forwarders deleted: `rootScopeFocusLevel`, `currentSiblingIndex`, `currentParentId`.** `NavigationState` is injected into the popover environment (`MenuBarController`); every view that reads them (`PopoverView` + its `+TaskRow`/`+QuickEntryBar` extensions, `KanbanBoardView`'s `KanbanColumnView`/`KanbanTaskCard`, `EisenhowerMatrixView`) now takes `@Environment(NavigationState.self)` and reads directly. Non-view readers (`CommandExecutor`, `KeyboardShortcutRouter`, `MenuBarController`) go through `manager.navigationState`; services (`SyncService`, `TaskMutationService`) through `coordinator.navigationState`; the `AppCoordinator+*` extensions through their own `navigationState`. One subtlety to keep in mind for the rest of the cull: a few non-view sites masquerade as views — e.g. `PopoverLayout.preferredHeight(for manager:)` is a static helper that only has the `manager` parameter, so it must use `manager.navigationState`, not a bare `navigationState`.
- **Both data-source protocols decoupled from `AppCoordinator` (step 3.7a — the unblocker).** `AppCoordinator` no longer conforms to `KanbanTaskDataSource` *or* `IntegrationDataSource`; dedicated adapters (`KanbanTaskDataSourceAdapter`, `IntegrationDataSourceAdapter`, both held strongly by `AppCoordinator` because the `dataSource` slots are `weak`) implement the protocols against `repository`/`navigationState`/`taskListViewModel` directly. `KanbanManager`/`IntegrationCoordinator` bodies are unchanged. This is what let `currentSiblingIndex`/`currentParentId`/`rootTaskView`/`hideFuture`/`cache`/`tasks` (all protocol members across the two protocols) be deleted. Note: `IntegrationDataSourceAdapter` still holds a `weak` `AppCoordinator` for `currentTask` alone — that property is genuinely coordinator-derived (dispatches on `rootTaskView` + kanban selection), and is the thing to move down onto TLVM/a navigation service next; doing so also unblocks deleting the `listId`/`activeCredentials` forwarders cleanly.
- **View-shaping persistence moved into `TaskListViewModel` (step 3.7b — the gate-clearer).** `rootTaskView`/`selectedRootDueBucketRawValue`/`selectedRootTag` now persist from TLVM's own `didSet`s (TLVM took a `PreferencesStore` dep and loads their initial values in `init`, where `didSet` doesn't fire).
- **`TaskListViewModel`-owned forwarders deleted (step 3.7c).** With persistence moved and the kanban adapter in place, `rootTaskView` / `selectedRootDueBucketRawValue` / `selectedRootTag` are gone from `AppCoordinator`; the `selectedRootDueBucket` typed wrapper moved onto TLVM too. `TaskListViewModel` is injected into the popover env alongside `NavigationState`; `PopoverView` and `KanbanTaskCard` read via `@Environment(TaskListViewModel.self)`. The `AppCoordinator+TaskScoping` filtering helpers (`taskMatchesActiveRootScope`, `shouldShowDueSectionHeaders`, `rootScopeShowsFilterControls`, `remainderSectionHeader`, `currentTask`) now read these off `taskListViewModel` directly — note this is the same logic TLVM already implements internally, so consolidating those duplicated helpers onto TLVM is a natural follow-up.
- **Cache-derived view helpers consolidated onto `TaskListViewModel` (step 3.7d).** The badge / section-header / tag / priority-rank helpers that previously lived as duplicates on `AppCoordinator+TaskScoping` moved to TLVM, where the `cache` they read already lives: `priorityRank` / `absolutePriorityRank` / `priorityPath` / `priorityBadgeLabel` / `eisenhowerBadgeLabel` (+ `formatEisenhowerCoordinate`), `remainderStartIndex`, `rootDueSectionHeader` / `remainderSectionHeader` / `rootDueSectionCount` (each self-contained via private `isRootLevel` / `shouldShowRootScopeSection` / `shouldShowDueSectionHeaders` on TLVM), `rootLevelTagNames`, and `isDescendant`. The dead-duplicate privates on the coordinator (`taskMatchesActiveRootScope`, `hasAnyTag`, `hasTag`, `rootDueBucket` — TLVM already implemented its own) were deleted. Views read via `@Environment(TaskListViewModel.self)` (`FocusSessionOverlay` gained the env declaration — it renders under the popover environment, so TLVM is injected); non-view callers go through `manager.taskListViewModel.X` / `coordinator.taskListViewModel.X` (the router, `PopoverLayout.preferredHeight`, `TaskNavigationService`, `TaskMutationService`, `subtreeBlockRange`).
- **`TaskNavigationService` narrowed (step 3.3 follow-up).** Now constructed with concrete `repository` + `navigationState` dependencies instead of reaching every forwarder through `coordinator`; the pure-forwarder hops read the concrete deps and two methods dropped their coordinator reference entirely. This is the template for narrowing `SyncService`/`TaskMutationService` next.
- **Optimistic-mutation failure handling consolidated.** `TaskMutationService.resolveMutationFailure(whenOffline:whenOnline:)` now owns the single offline-vs-online reachability branch that was copy-pasted across six mutation paths (`taskAction`, `updateTask`, `addTask`, `addTaskAsChild`, `submitQuickAddTask`, `deleteTask`). The `applyOptimisticMoveAndSync` / `addTaskInKanbanColumn` paths on `AppCoordinator` itself still hand-roll the dance (and `applyOptimisticMoveAndSync` writes `pendingTaskMutations` directly rather than through `enqueuePendingMutation`, so it skips the disk write-through — latent inconsistency worth fixing when those move into the service).

See `docs/state-ownership.md` for the current owner-of-record map used to navigate this.
- ~~Remove the `AppCoordinator+*.swift` extension pattern entirely~~ — **Partially done.** Five extension files are gone (`+Navigation`, `+TaskSync`, `+TaskMutations`, `+QuickAdd`, `+Undo`). Three remain, but each has been further trimmed in the step 3.7 cleanup pass (76 / 157 / 303 LOC):
  - `+StateAndLifecycle` — the trivial repository forwarders (`savePriorityQueue`, `removeTasksFromPriorityQueue`, `reconcilePriorityQueueWithOpenTasks`, `beginLoading`, `endLoading`, `withLoadingState`, `setAuthenticationRequiredErrorIfNeeded`, `runBooleanMutation`) were deleted; the services (`SyncService`, `TaskMutationService`) call `repository.X` directly. What's left is keychain bootstrap, onboarding-dialog management, and `reconcilePendingObsidianSyncQueueWithOpenTasks` (a genuine cross-manager helper).
  - `+TaskScoping` — the priority-on-current-task mutations (`setPriorityForCurrentTask`, `setAbsolutePriorityForCurrentTask`, `sendCurrentTaskToPriorityBack`, `clearPriorityForCurrentTask`, `clearAbsolutePriorityForCurrentTask`) moved into `TaskMutationService`; callers go through `manager.taskMutationService.X`. The `invalidateCaches` / `ensureVisibleTasksCacheValid` forwarders were deleted (callers go through `taskListViewModel.X`). The cache-derived view helpers were consolidated onto `TaskListViewModel` in step 3.7d (see below). What's left is connection-state derivations, view-derived properties (`currentTask`, `visibleTasks`, `breadcrumbs`, `currentTaskChildren`, `currentLevelTasks`), the root-scope section gates that still feed `currentTask`/the router (`isRootLevel`, `shouldShowRootScopeSection`, `rootScopeShowsFilterControls`, `isSearchFilterActive`), and `shouldShowBreadcrumbPath` (kept on the coordinator because it reads `preferences.showTaskBreadcrumbContext`, a `PreferencesManager` dep TLVM doesn't hold).
  - `+ReorderingAndTiming` — `subtreeBlockRange`, command/date helpers, and the timer/cache roll-up accessors. The roll-up accessors (`totalElapsed`, `childCountByTaskId`, `rolledUpElapsedByTaskId`) deliberately touch `timer.timerByTaskId` to re-subscribe SwiftUI on tick boundaries; that's a deliberate observation hook, not a forwarder.

### Phase 3 outcome (step 3.6 — method forwarder cull)

After Layers 1–4 of the cull every method forwarder pointing at a new service is gone:
- `manager.lastUndo` / `undoLastAction()` → `manager.undoService.lastAction` / `.undo()`
- `manager.nextTask()` / `previousTask()` / `enterChildren()` / `exitToParent()` / `navigateTo(task:)` / `clampSelectionToVisibleRange()` → `manager.taskNavigationService.X` (with `navigateTo(task:)` → `navigate(to:)`)
- `manager.setRootTaskView(_:)` / `cycleRootTaskView(direction:)` / `cycleRootScopeFilter(direction:)` / `selectRootScopeFilter(at:)` → `manager.taskNavigationService.X`
- `manager.markCurrentTaskDone()` / `reopenCurrentTask()` / `invalidateCurrentTask()` / `taskAction(_:endpoint:isUndo:)` / `updateTask(...)` / `addTask(...)` / `addTaskAsChild(...)` / `deleteTask(_:isUndo:)` / `createNextOccurrence(for:)` / `beginQuickAddEntry(...)` / `setQuickAddSpecificLocationToCurrentTask()` / `submitQuickAddTask(...)` → `manager.taskMutationService.X`
- `manager.login()` / `fetchTopTask()` / `fetchLists()` / `loadCheckvistLists(...)` / `switchCheckvistList(to:)` / `createCheckvistListAndSwitch(name:)` / `mergeOpenTasksBetweenLists(...)` / `selectList(_:)` / `uploadOfflineTasksToCheckvist(...)` / `flushPendingTaskMutations()` → `manager.syncService.X`
- `manager.moveTask(_:direction:)` / `movePriorityTask(_:direction:)` / `indentTask(_:)` / `unindentTask(_:)` → `manager.syncService.X` (the kanban `moveTask(id:toColumn:)` overload stays on AppCoordinator — it's a real method, not a forwarder)

Wiring side-effect: `UndoActionPerforming` conformance moved from `AppCoordinator` to `TaskMutationService` (which actually owns those methods now). `AppCoordinator.init` constructs `taskMutationService` first, then `UndoService(performer: self.taskMutationService)`.

Internal callers in services also retargeted: `TaskMutationService` calls `coordinator.taskNavigationService.clampSelectionToVisibleRange()` and `coordinator.syncService.fetchTopTask()` directly; `SyncService` calls `coordinator.taskMutationService.updateTask(...)`; `LifecycleController` calls `coordinator.syncService.flushPendingTaskMutations()`; `AppDelegate` calls `checkvistManager.syncService.fetchTopTask()` and `checkvistManager.taskMutationService.beginQuickAddEntry()`.

### Phase 4 — Split oversized views

- [x] `PopoverView.swift` (2,068 LOC) → **done.** Split into the main shell (1,273 LOC) plus two extension files: `PopoverView+TaskRow.swift` (451 LOC — `taskRow`, `dueSectionHeader`, and every badge: timer/priority/matrix/start/recurrence/due/metadata-token, plus `formatTaskContent` and the inline-tag formatter) and `PopoverView+QuickEntryBar.swift` (359 LOC — `quickEntryBar`, the icon/placeholder/font/sequence-hint helpers, and the submit/escape/tab/empty-list-composer actions). `MarqueeTextLine` and several helpers (`themeColor`, `isAddMode`, `activePromptText`, `activePromptTextBinding`, `clearPrompt`, `shouldShowEmptyListComposer`) dropped `private` so the extensions can see them. `breadcrumbPath(for:includeCurrentParent:)` stays in `PopoverView.swift` because both extensions need it. The full plan-vision split (`PopoverHeader`, dedicated `TaskListPane`, separate overlay file) wasn't necessary to clear the lint error limit — those further splits are available if `PopoverView.swift` grows again.
- [x] `SettingsView.swift` (1,473 LOC) → **done.** Main file is now 517 LOC; the four panes live as extensions in their own files: `SettingsView+DebugPane.swift` (19 LOC), `SettingsView+ThemePane.swift` (189 LOC), `SettingsView+KeybindingsPane.swift` (457 LOC), `SettingsView+PreferencesPane.swift` (316 LOC). The pane bodies stay as `var <pane>Pane: some View` on `SettingsView` so `selectedPaneContent` dispatches normally — `@State` properties have to live on the original struct, so they were upgraded from `private` to internal. The plugins pane stays in the main file (it already enumerates plugins generically via `pluginCards` / `userPluginCards`).
- [x] **Plugin status-label convention fix** (called out in `docs/plugins.md`): `SettingsView.pluginStatusLabel(for:)` had a switch on plugin identifier (`"native.checkvist.sync"` → `checkvistManager.checkvistIntegrationEnabled`, etc.). Replaced with a new `sidebarStatusLabel(manager:)` requirement on `PluginSettingsPageProviding` (default = `"Built-in plugin"`); each of the four native plugins overrides it in its `+Settings.swift` to report Enabled/Disabled against its own toggle state. `SettingsView` now calls `page.plugin.sidebarStatusLabel(manager: checkvistManager)` with no plugin-aware branching.
- [x] `KanbanManager.swift` (was 794 LOC) → separate column-state ownership from filter/sort logic. **Done in the 2026-08-18 audit**, exactly as predicted here: `subtreeTasks`, `columnForTask`, `taskMatchesCondition` and `sortedForKanban` moved into a `KanbanFilter` namespace in `TaktCore` that takes its inputs as parameters instead of reaching through `dataSource`, generic over `VisibilityTask` so it needs no app types. `KanbanColumn.swift` moved into `CoreLogic/` alongside it. `KanbanManager` is 702 LOC and now owns board *state*; the rules are covered by 23 tests. The prompt was testability rather than lint pressure — the note below was right that the file length was never the point.

### Phase 5 — MCP isolation (optional, lower priority)

- [x] **Done, differently.** The plan here was to extract `MCPServer` into a separate executable target and have the app invoke it. What happened instead is that the server was *deleted*: the Rust CLI already implemented every tool identically, so the app bundles that binary at `Contents/Helpers/takt` and `--mcp-server` `execv`s it. The concern recorded below — that extraction would either strand installed client configurations or add a child-process indirection for little benefit — was the right concern and is what the shim answers: configurations keep working, and there is no supervision because the process is replaced rather than spawned. See finding 6.

- [x] **Done (step 5.2):** Promoted the canonical Checkvist data types (`CheckvistNote`, `CheckvistTask`, `CheckvistList`, plus the freshly-extracted `CheckvistTaskCachePayload`, `CheckvistSessionError`, `ObsidianOpenMode`) into `TaktPlugins` sources by un-excluding `CheckvistModels.swift` and splitting `CheckvistTaskCachePayload` / `CheckvistSessionError` / `ObsidianOpenMode` into focused files under their plugin folders. Removed the six duplicate type definitions from `plugin-tests-support/PluginModelStubs.swift`; what remains there is the four genuine app-service fakes (`ObsidianSyncService`, `CheckvistSession`, `CheckvistTaskRepository`, `GoogleOAuthLoopbackReceiver`) the plugin code reaches into directly — the file header now describes that accurately.

  Also marked `CheckvistModels.swift`'s two static date-formatter arrays `nonisolated(unsafe)` (they were fine in the Xcode build but tripped SPM's strict concurrency check once the file landed in the plugin target).

  **Not done (separate concern):**
  - `applogic-support/AppLogicSharedTypes.swift` still re-declares the Checkvist types for `TaktAppLogic`. Sharing them via `import TaktPlugins` would require turning every imported type (`Plugin`, `CheckvistSyncPlugin`, `CheckvistTask` and friends) `public` — that meaningfully broadens the plugin library's API surface and is left as follow-on work.
  - The four service fakes in `PluginModelStubs.swift` still exist because the plugin code references the concrete service types (`ObsidianSyncService`, `CheckvistSession`, etc.) directly. Eliminating those requires introducing protocol seams for those services first — a structural refactor outside Phase 5.2's documented scope.

### Post-Phase-4 audit (2026-08-18)

An external audit of the whole tree. What it changed:

- **Two data-loss bugs in the offline queue.** `applyOptimisticMoveAndSync` on
  `AppCoordinator` wrote `repository.pendingTaskMutations` directly, bypassing
  the write-through enqueue, so an offline task-move edit never reached disk.
  And `SyncService.flushPendingTaskMutations` called `clearPendingOfflineWork()`
  — which wipes the persisted payload — *before* issuing its first request, so
  quitting mid-flush discarded every item that had not yet failed. The replay
  now removes each item only once the server confirms it, re-files work behind a
  succeeded create under the real id, and refuses to run twice concurrently.
- **The derived cache is now observable.** `TaskListViewModel.cacheStorage` is
  `@ObservationIgnored`, so a view reading the cache while it happened to be
  clean registered no SwiftUI dependency and never updated again — and whether
  that happened depended on whether a non-view reader (`KanbanManager`) had
  cleared the dirty flag first. A hand-maintained list of `_ = repository.x`
  touches in `visibleTasks` covered one of the fifteen accessors and had already
  fallen behind its inputs (the priority queues drive row ordering and were
  missing). Replaced by an observable `cacheVersion` read inside
  `ensureVisibleTasksCacheValid()`, before its early return.
- **The visibility layer moved into `TaktCore`.** `TaskVisibilityEngine` and
  `TaskFilterEngine` are pure `import Foundation` and decide what the user sees,
  but belonged to no SPM target and so had no tests. They are now generic over a
  new `VisibilityTask` protocol — stating the six properties the algorithms
  actually read — with `CheckvistTask` conforming in a one-line app-side
  extension. 36 new tests. Writing them found an unguarded ancestor walk that
  spins forever on a parent cycle; four such walks were found and fixed
  (`TaskFilterEngine.isDescendant`, `TaskVisibilityEngine`'s priority fold,
  `TaskListViewModel.breadcrumbs` and `computePriorityPaths`,
  `PopoverView.breadcrumbPath`).
- **The kanban mutations left `AppCoordinator`.** `applyOptimisticUpdate` and
  `addRootTask` now live on `TaskMutationService` (in
  `TaskMutationService+Board.swift`) and go through `resolveMutationFailure`
  like every other mutation. This is why the bugs above existed: they were the
  last two paths hand-rolling the dance. The add path had *no* offline branch at
  all — a card added while disconnected was discarded. `AppCoordinator` keeps
  only the adapter that turns a `KanbanColumn` into content/due.
- **The Python MCP server is gone.** `scripts/priority_mcp_server.py` (1,897
  LOC) existed as a fallback for when the app binary could not be resolved,
  which the Rust CLI already covers. It made every tool change a three-way edit.
  `scripts/mcp_parity_check.py` then drove the two remaining implementations
  and *failed* on a missing build of either, rather than skipping — with only
  two left, a skip would have left it comparing Swift to itself. It went when
  the Swift server did: with one implementation there is nothing to hold
  equal, and `scripts/mcp_smoke_check.py` checks the handover seam instead.
- **SwiftLint runs in CI.** It never had, so the file-length *error* limit this
  document calls "the constraint" was never enforced. Non-strict, so errors
  block and the 13 standing warnings don't. See Open Finding 4.
- **The keybinding token format is tested.** `ShortcutKeyToken` moved into
  `TaktCore` next to `ConfigurableShortcutAction`, whose defaults have to
  agree with it. That found `rootFilter7`'s dead `"comma"` binding. See Open
  Finding 1.
- **The shadow types are pinned.** `applogic-tests/SharedTypeDriftTests.swift`
  compares the two declarations of `CheckvistTask` / `CheckvistList` /
  `CheckvistNote` / `CheckvistTaskAction` directly. It immediately found that
  `CheckvistNote` had already drifted — the shadow was missing `created_at` and
  `updated_at`. See Open Finding 2.
- **Four unbounded ancestor walks.** A parent cycle — impossible in server data,
  reachable from a corrupt cache — would spin forever on the main actor during a
  cache rebuild, freezing the app rather than showing wrong rows. All four now
  carry a visited set.
- **Day-log read amplification.** `DailyLogService.reloadFromDisk()` decoded the
  whole append-only log and compared the entire array on every directory event,
  including this process's own writes — so the cost of recording an event grew
  with the length of the user's history. Two `stat` calls short-circuit it now.
- **`KanbanFilter` extracted.** The board's membership and ordering rules came
  out of `KanbanManager` into `TaktCore`, closing the Phase 4 item that had
  been deferred for want of lint pressure. 23 tests on card placement and the
  five-way sort tie-break, which had none. See Open Finding 3.
- **Finding 6 re-examined rather than re-deferred.** The reason given for
  keeping the in-process MCP server — that only it can reach the app's
  `UserDefaults` — is not true of the Rust CLI, which reads the same plist by
  bundle id. The only remaining reason is installed client configs. See Open
  Finding 6 for the migration that would follow from deciding that.
- **`hasPendingOfflineWork` can drive UI.** It was computed entirely from
  `@ObservationIgnored` storage, so it could never have. A revision counter
  bumped by the two write-through points closes that without making the hot
  queues observable.
- Smaller: `AppCoordinator.statusMessage`'s auto-clear is generation-guarded so
  overlapping messages stop cutting each other short; `OptimisticTaskID` reads
  its cursor from the store it was passed rather than always
  `UserDefaults.standard`.

### Findings sweep (2026-08-18, second pass)

Closing the audit's open list. In order:

- **`KanbanSelection`** — the second half of `KanbanManager` into `TaktCore`,
  working on a grid of task ids so it needs no app types. 26 tests. Also removed
  a per-column re-filter that ran on every arrow key.
- **`PendingSyncQueue` / `IntegrationLinkStore`** — the pure rules out of
  `IntegrationCoordinator`. 22 tests. The MCP half needed nothing; it was
  already factored.
- **`ShortcutGate`, `ShortcutSequenceBuffer`, `ShortcutResolver`** — the
  router's modal gates, its two-key state machine, and an ordered table of every
  binding's availability that the router now consults instead of restating.
  **Found a live bug**: the Daily view's Cmd+↑/↓ reorder was unreachable behind
  an unguarded general branch. Also corrected this document's claim about the
  `cmd+k` alias, which is reachable — just only while typing.
- **The in-process MCP server deleted** (finding 6), and the app now ships the
  Rust CLI as a signed helper. ~2,500 lines of Swift and Python gone, plus a CI
  job.
- **`Sources/TaktCore`, linked rather than compiled** (finding 2). The move
  itself was mechanical; what it changed is that `TaktAppLogic` and
  `TaktPlugins` can now import `TaktCore`, which this document had
  recorded as impossible. `OfflineReplayPolicy` came home and the due-date
  parsing is shared rather than duplicated into the shadow type.
- **`TaskListViewModel` reachable at last** (finding 3) via a
  `TaskListViewModelHost` seam. 12 tests, including one that fails if the
  `_ = cacheVersion` line is removed — the observation fix that is invisible by
  eye.
- **A crash found by those tests.** `TimerStore.rolledUpElapsedByTaskId`
  recursed into a parent-chain cycle forever: `SIGSEGV`, from data that arrives
  over the network. The audit had guarded four ancestor walks; this one walks
  *children*, so it was missed.

Tests 455 → **570**. SwiftLint warnings 13 → **9**, none suppressed.

### Since then, 2026-09-16

The desktop workspace grew past those numbers and this document did not
follow. Recorded here rather than silently left stale:

- Tests 570 → **983**. The new ones are `workspace-tests/`: the store, the
  Inbox's system role, FTS search, the undo journal, and the migration ladder.
- SwiftLint warnings 9 → **19**, none suppressed and none of them new kinds.
  All ten are `file_length` / `type_body_length` on the workspace files, which
  arrived with it: `WorkspaceDesktopView.swift` (1,396 counted lines),
  `WorkspaceViewModel.swift` (1,011), `WorkspaceStore.swift`, and one
  `redundant_discardable_let` in `WorkspaceDailiesView.swift`. The split-by-
  extension pattern the rest of the app uses (`+Sidebar`, `+Focus`, `+Search`,
  `+History`) is the obvious remedy and has not been applied to the two views.
- `WorkspaceStore` is now split as `+Dailies`, `+Import`, `+Search`, `+Undo`.
- 2026-09-28: `WorkspaceViewModel.swift` is split the same way (`+Import`,
  `+Loading`, `+Selection`, `+KeyboardFocus`, `+ListManagement`,
  `+TaskMutations`), leaving ~690 lines of stored state, init and `load()`.
  Its `file_length` and `type_body_length` warnings are gone: 24 → **22**.
- 2026-10-07: a lint pass cleared everything that was not a tracked length or
  complexity warning. The counts above are history from here on; the live
  number is in `TODO.md` and nowhere else.

## Out of Scope

- Replacing `@Observable` / SwiftUI patterns. The concurrency model (`@MainActor` everywhere, async/await for I/O) is sound; don't churn it.
- `FocusCore/` package — sibling, unrelated, leave alone.
- SwiftLint config relaxation. The 1,500-LOC error limit is the *constraint*, not the problem; raising it would mask Phase 4.

## How to use this document

- When opening a PR that lands part of a phase, check the box and link the PR.
- When a finding turns out to be wrong or stale, edit the Findings section — don't leave drift between this doc and the code.
- New architectural problems get appended to Findings with a file:line citation; only promote to a phase once the fix is scoped.
