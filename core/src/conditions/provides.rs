//! Conditions that provide others, and what holds once they have.
//!
//! A condition can provide others: being at Home means Floor space, a Desk
//! and Quiet; having the Laptop means Typing and a Big screen. You say the
//! few things that are settings — where you are, what you have with you —
//! and what they provide holds with them, so a task that needs Floor space
//! is offered at Home or the Gym without anyone turning Floor space on.
//!
//! What holds (**effective conditions**) is the conditions said to hold
//! directly, plus everything they provide, through any number of links,
//! less the provided ones switched off for now ("housemates in": Quiet
//! off). Every check of a task against the context — availability, the
//! ranking, its explanation, the "waiting" counts, Next Up — reads that one
//! set, so a negated requirement ("not Quiet") is met by switching Quiet
//! off as much as by never providing it. [`holdings`] is the one place it is
//! worked out.
//!
//! A switched-off condition stays off until whatever provides it is unset
//! or replaced: saying you are at the Library rather than Home brings
//! Home's overrides to an end (`focus_context::save`, through
//! [`kept_overrides`]).
//!
//! Links are stored on the providing condition (`providesJSON`, v34), so
//! they sync, merge and undo with it. Archived conditions provide nothing
//! and are provided by nothing; a link to a condition that has gone is
//! ignored, and dropped the next time the list is written. A condition
//! cannot provide itself, and a cycle (Home provides Quiet, Quiet provides
//! Home) is harmless: each condition is visited once per setting, so the
//! walk ends however the links loop. A client older than v34 drops the
//! column on pull and simply derives nothing.
