//! The catalogue proper: every key the desktop workspace answers to, once.
//!
//! Ordering within a group is roughly most-pressed-first, because the
//! palette shows this order when nothing has been typed and the reference
//! sheet reads top to bottom. A new command needs a case in the Mac's
//! `WorkspaceCommandID` (and its `run` arm) and an entry here; a test on each
//! side holds the two to one another. Keys are spelled as `keymap.rs` says.
//! Moved from `Sources/TaktCore/WorkspaceCommandCatalog+Entries.swift`.
