//! Which of the MCP server's tools only read, and which write.
//!
//! The Mac's agent panel pre-allows the reads on the assistant's command line
//! and sends every write through an approval card (`AgentToolPolicy` in
//! Swift, `docs/agent-panel.md`). The table itself is the CLI's
//! (`cli/src/tools.rs`), but the app cannot link the CLI, so the
//! classification lives here, where both can reach it: the CLI's tests hold
//! its declared tools to exactly these two lists, so a tool added there
//! without being classified here fails a test instead of drifting.
//!
//! The read list is an allow-list on purpose. A tool missing from both is
//! treated as a write by the panel, so forgetting one costs a click rather
//! than a change nobody saw.

/// The tools that change nothing: the Checkvist reads, the local day log and
/// dailies, the focus clock (opened read-only by the CLI) and the workspace
/// tree.
