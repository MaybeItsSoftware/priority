//! The day and the focus ladder in one read, so only what is shown crosses.
//!
//! The Mac used to read every candidate (`focus::candidates`) into Swift, plan
//! the day there, and hand every candidate back across for the ranking, which
//! returned them all again. At a few thousand open tasks that was three
//! crossings of every candidate per write, where the work itself was a few
//! milliseconds. Here the candidates are read, the day planned and the ladder
//! ranked without leaving the core, and the ladder is cut to what a client
//! draws.
