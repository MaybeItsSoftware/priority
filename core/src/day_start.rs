//! Starting each day afresh: at the hour the day changes, what holds goes
//! back to the conditions the user starts every day with (Home), the
//! overrides and the time window go with whatever was said yesterday.
//!
//! The hour is the one Takt already counts days from — the daily log's
//! rollover (`day_log`, 04:00 by default), so a session finishing at 01:30
//! and the context said at 01:30 belong to the same day. What used
//! to be one Mac's preference is now the account's, kept with the starting
//! conditions as synced `preferences` rows, as Google Calendar's choices
//! are: every device reads the same hour and the same set.
//!
//! Nothing runs at the boundary. Each client calls [`apply`] whenever it
//! evaluates — at launch, on coming to the foreground, after a pull, and the
//! Mac on a timer — and the first call after the boundary resets the
//! context, so a device closed for days resets once when it next opens. The
//! day it last reset is a synced preference too, so once any device has
//! reset today, none does again. A context said since the day began wins
//! over the reset: a device that pulls what you said at 06:00 on another
//! one, before its own first evaluation, keeps it rather than putting you
//! back at Home.
