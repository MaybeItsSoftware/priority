/// One agent thread: the user's own coding agent, headless, with Takt's MCP
/// server as its only tool. Which agent is `clientSetting` (Settings ▸ Agent,
/// or the panel's header), read when a thread starts: a thread stays on the
/// agent it started with, and the next one uses whatever is chosen then.
///
/// With Claude Code the process is `claude -p` in stream-json mode (see
/// `AgentInvocation` for the exact command line and why each flag is there).
/// It stays up for the thread, so a follow-up is one more line on its stdin,
/// and it goes when the thread does: Stop and New thread both end it. Codex
/// runs a process per turn instead (`AgentCodexInvocation`), each one resuming
/// the thread by its id, and Stop and New thread forget the id.
///
/// **Changes apply at once and each can be taken back.** The reads and the
/// writes are pre-allowed on the command line, and every write shows as a
/// card saying what it changed, with an Undo that reverts exactly that step
/// (`WorkspaceViewModel.undoAgentChange`). With "Ask before changing tasks"
/// on (Settings ▸ Agent, read when a thread starts) the writes are not
/// pre-allowed: each stops inside the CLI on a `can_use_tool` control request
/// that only `approve(_:)` answers yes to, from a button. A tool in neither
/// list asks either way. A request left alone just waits; stopping the
/// thread, starting a new one, quitting the app or the process dying all
/// withdraw it — the CLI that asked is gone, so the call can never run.
